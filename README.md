# SpaceT
	Imagine Space Invaders and Tetris combined into one game.
that is the point of this project. So far in the development we have
a semi-working copy of Tetris. The game will be split into two different
modes: one version where you play Tetris, and the second mode you play
Space Invaders.


	While you're playing Tetris, every time you destroy a row
an extra set of strong enemies will be sent to the space invaders side.
These enemies will be marked so to distinguish them from the rest.

	The space invaders side of game will shoot down enemies either generated by the game or
the Tetris side of the game.
After a certain number of perfectly accurate shots or quickly destroying enemies,
a special Tetris block(s) will be generated on the Tetris side.

	This game is planning to support three basic modes:
Two players(local) - this is the one we are working hardest toward.
Single player
Two players(LAN/Internet)
