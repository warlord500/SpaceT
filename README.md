# SpaceT
Imagine Space Invaders and Tetris combined into one game.
That is the point of this project. So far, we have
a working copy of Tetris and a semi-working copy of space invaders. The game will be split into two different
modes: one version where you play Tetris, and the second mode where you play
Space Invaders.

While you're playing Tetris, every time you destroy a row,
an extra set of strong enemies will be sent to the space invaders side.
These enemies will be marked so to distinguish them from the rest.

The space invaders side of game will have the player shoot down enemies either
generated by the computer or the Tetris side of the game.
After a certain number of perfectly accurate shots or quickly destroying enemies,
special Tetris block(s) will be generated on the Tetris side.

This game is planning to support three basic modes:
Two players(local) (this is the one we are working hardest toward), Single player, and Two
players(LAN/Internet)
